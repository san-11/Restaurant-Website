  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <div class="about">
    
    <p>We are wildly strategic in how we break the rules of proper cooking to bring you creative combinations even carnivores will love.
    Our scratch kitchen is chef-driven. That means flavor is at the heart of every healthy meal we plate, juice we squeeze, and cocktail we craft. We make our plant-based meals with farm-fresh, seasonal produce because it tastes better, and we source local and organic wherever we can. You’ll never find hydrogenated oils, food dyes, artificial flavorings or preservatives here, and we always use the freshest ingredients we can find.</p>
    <p>Come as you are—yoga pants or cocktail dresses—and stay until you’re full. You won’t regret a single bite.</p>
